# Speed coding projects
This project contains all speed coding projects realized during my streaming sessions (habitually the saturday morning).
You can join me on twitch [here](https://www.twitch.tv/jintuslive).

The idea is that the viewers pick a design, and I have to integrate it with only HTML and CSS for Web projects or with Flutter for mobile ones.
